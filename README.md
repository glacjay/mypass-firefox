# MyPass for Firefox

**MyPass** is a tool to generate *different passwords for different sites* with a given passphrase. It uses the password generation algorithm of [One Shall Pass](https://oneshallpass.com/) (1SP). You can specify options like password length, number of symbols, etc.

This is the Firefox version of the original [**MyPass**](https://github.com/cyfdecyf/mypass).

Note: **MyPass does NOT ignore spaces in your passphrase**, this is different from 1SP.

The password generation code is mostly hand compiled from the original **MyPass**, which is mostly copied from 1SP.

Icon copied from **MyPass** too, which is designed by @naruil.
